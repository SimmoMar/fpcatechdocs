Controlling the Equipment
-------------------------

The Rack
========

Behind the organ in the sanctuary, there are two equipment racks with a variety of components in them.  You are not expected to change any of this configuration or worry about 
any settings in particular.  If special accommodations are required for a particular performer or ensemble, an audio enginner 
will be available to assist.

The Left Half
=============

The left half of the rig has the following components in it to serve the following functions

In order:

#. UHF antenna distributor - amplifies the signals from our microphones back to the rack for wireless transmission.
#. Shure ULXD4Q - wireless microphone receiver for the 3 pastor headsets and the spare headset microphone
#. Shure PSM900 - wireless in-ear monitor (IEM) transmitter for the Live Stream channel
#. Mackie DL32R - the heart and soul of EVERYTHING.  A 32-channel mixer with 14 outputs.  Everything audio goes through here.
#. Shure Wireless Receivers - (obsolete) previously used for microphones we aren't using right now.
#. Power Distributor - this is where the master power switch is for the PDU used for the whole rack
