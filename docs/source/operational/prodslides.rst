    .. warning:: 

       Please ONLY do this if the mouse doesn't wake the iMac up

Routing Audio to the Apple TV
*****************************

Because we may show movies and other media from the iMac to the projector via the Apple TV, we need 
to ensure that audio is properly routed to the HDMI connector on the projector which feeds the mixer.

#. Find the little speaker icon on the menu bar at the top of the screen to target the audio.

   .. figure:: ../../images/productions/Audio-Icon.png
      :alt: The audio icon is found in the top menu bar of either monitor

#. Be sure that the Apple TV is the target output destination for audio, as seen in the image below.
