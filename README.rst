Installating / Running This Thing Locally
=======================================

Installing Sphinx
----------

You gotta have Sphinx to install this thing.

To do this, you must have a good Python installation and then do this:

``choco install sphinx``

More reading on that here:

https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html

Installing Sphinx Default Theme
----------

Once you have Sphinx installed, you need the default template to build the project.

``pip install sphinx-rtd-theme``

Cool.  Now you should be ready to build.

Building for Local Test
----------

Look for the make.bat file.  You can run it like this:

``make html``

Once done, you can find the created index.html file and view it.  Happy testing!
